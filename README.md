# The-Extreme-Model
### SHADERS | THREE.JS | JS | OPENGL | C | HTML
#### If "we" exist in an extreme model, mountains, lakes, water, vapour and sunlight are created, then who created all this? Are we really "existence" or expression? What is the end of time and distance? Apart from "we", what else is there besides "we"?

#### This is an interactive work completed entirely by the programming language, and the viewer can use the keyboard to control the launch of the rocket.

#### Background
I love the movie called Interstellar a lot since 5 years ago, I’m interested in galaxies, black holes, 4D space, 5D space and so on.
So the thing about space, robots, and rockets appears several times in my weekly practices, what I wish is to make a little game, using a keyboard to simulate some part of 4D space’s fragment. Apparently, I didn’t make it work that well, so when I moved the code from the visual studio to the mimic, I used the time to control the camera instead of a keyboard, Let's just call it the Extreme model.

#### Plans
The plans was,
* build a plant with a rocket (built by several geometries with fire png at the bottom) and an astronaut (insert a 3d file which build by Rhino and use shader to give it some color changes):astronaut:;
* Let users could move the astronaut by using keyboards, when it has been moved into the right position area inside the rocket( if x2<number1 && >nubmer2, y2<number3 && >nubmer4, z2<number5 && >nubmer6);
* After that, the rocket, astronaut and the camera start to (“for loop” &“i++”...on their “y”);
* Build stars space outside the plant with the code from “Week 05 Space ”(https://mimicproject.com/code/31afd229-c643-e331-2c0d-c8283de7f816);
* Use week (1 & 2)’s code to write the sound of launch the rocket;
* If time, built a space station.

#### Challenges
One hard thing for me is to write a correct sentence. Because I do not know much of functions and right ways. So, every time I want to write a sentence I need to search for an example, the mimic links from other classmates really helps a lot.

The challenges that I still did not figured out are,
* When I move the code from the visual studio to the mimic, the keyboard could not work, and the mouse keeps disappearing, only click on “esc” could make the mouse shown again (sometimes not);
* I combined too many people’s coding and sometimes I didn’t write common, so it is really hard to read now;
* I still do not know how to load a 3D geometry file, have not got enough time to really watch some tutorial videos online;
* How to make the shaders more visible on the middle one SphereGeometry；
* How to write “coding” music instead of the music sounds like made by logic or garageband.


#### Things I did
I figured out how to achieve some of those functions by using google, watch some videos, read C++/ C/ JS “dictionary”, copy some of code online (which is always fail), ask classmates for help...
(Sorry for always not booking a tutorial, I’d really love to but always feel too nervous to do that, because when I use english to ask coding or tech problems, I can’t ask or understand clearly some of those professional words. But I believe I could make it better during the holiday, I am building a “Yuwei Coding Dictionary”).

#### The thing that I really need to be helped with
For to make better projects in the future and get to do things with coding better, I wish to make a study plan during the holiday. I was major in product design and know a little bit thing about python and raspberry pie, and I’m really interested in coding(no matter for art or coding it self). 
So I really want to study those essential coding languages well and also make a preparing for next session’s courses, to know what I should learn deeper, what I should pre-learn, and how to learn the coding better are really important to me.

#### My goal
I’m really interesting in metaverse, also coding art(both visual and music), I hope that I could join some companies which aims to do more things about metaverse. Apart from that, I also want to be an coding artist. I know I am sooo behind from my goal, so I want to try my best to see what I could achieve, not only in those 1.5 years, but also doing it step by step in the future.
 If I could have any suggestions about any those things I would be sooooo appreciate:robot: 

#### My plans
My plans was to
* Foundation：Review courses; learn C and Js from basic during the holiday; also learn some things about Unity; build my dictionary and vocabulary. (I guess I should make a more detailed plans);
* About being an artist: do some more weekly practices and publish them somewhere( maybe NFT or some social platform? And peosonal webset);
* About career: do more research about those companies who need those people working on building virtual workld(not only for games);

But I’m not pretty sure if my plans are good enough, If I could have any suggestions about any those things I would be sooooooooooo appreciate and try my best to do it well❤
